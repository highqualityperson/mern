## Epic 1: MERN Stack Diagram

### Task 1: Conduct research into the MERN stack architecture

Start by learning about the stack. This introduction to the MEAN and MERN stacks made by a MongoDB developer is a great place to start. It describes the primary elements in the stack as well as some of the benefits of modern javascript-based architecture.

### Task 2: Build the MERN stack diagram

Make a copy and complete the slides for the presentation of the MERN Diagram slides. Make sure to add useful comments to describes every aspect of the diagram.

The diagram should not be an exact replica of what you find on the web and must be explained in your own words (no copy and paste!).

### Task 3: Share your presentation with your Slack group

When you've completed your presentation, share the link on the Slack channel. To get the link, click Share (top right corner of Google Slides) > Get Shareable Link. Note: make sure that the viewer has comment access!
